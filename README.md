Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the tropical Pacific, such as El Niño-SouthernOscillation (ENSO) events, can cause intensified air-sea couplings and different climate impacts. Althoughthere are quite a few indices describing the event magnitude, little attention is paid to directly measuring air-sea coupling strengths. Using Dynamical Systems Metrics, we introduce an index to quantify air-sea couplingstrengths over the tropical Pacific. This coupling index explains the relatively weak impact of the super ElNiño in 2015/2016, and characterizes the ENSO diversity and asymmetry. Particularly, this index can identifyseveral unusual neutral days with prolonged strong air-sea couplings, where SST anomaly distributions are notas homogeneous as the ENSO events, but which have caused intense climate impacts. Our results demonstratethe close relationship among air-sea coupling strengths, SST anomalies, and coupled feedbacks, which maypromote better understandings on the events diversity related to SST anomalies over the tropical Pacific.
